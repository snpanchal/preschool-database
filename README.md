# preschool-database
This is a preschool management application that allows the owner to more effectively organize students and their details.

This application consists of a program written in Java and a GUI built using FXML; all files  are in the *project* directory of this repository. Additionally, a database is used to organize the data for all students, and the relational database management system SQLite is used in conjunction with Java to query and modify the database through this application. 

The included JAR file in the repository, *PreschoolDatabase.jar*, is the GUI application for this database query and modification system. The JAR file can be executed by downloading it and double-clicking on it. Additionally, typing the following command in a CLI will also run the JAR file (make sure the CLI is set to the directory that contains the JAR file):
```bash
java -jar PreschoolDatabase.jar
```
