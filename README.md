# preschool-database
The current stages of a preschool management application that allows the owner to easily query and update student details.

This front-end of this application is currently being developed, however, the back-end of the application is complete, though it has not been thoroughly tested yet. The back-end of this application consists of a program written in Java, all files for which are in the *project* directory of this repository. It uses SQLite as a database management system to query and update the database.

The included JAR file in the repository, *PreschoolDatabase.jar*, is the console application for this database query and modification system. The JAR file can be executed by executing the following command in a CLI (make sure it is set to the directory that contains the JAR file):
```bash
java -jar PreschoolDatabase.jar
```
